﻿Data is the most important global resource and, unlike money, we can make everyone rich in data from all over the world. This resource is needed to predict the consequences of our actions as accurately as possible and that everybody of us would work together to bring maximum benefit to each other. We know what profit the data owners have, they improve our lives by connecting consumers with offerings. However, they do not share this data with a huge number of people who also would like to make your life better. This leads to the fact that such monopolists are getting richer, and the level of well-being rises, but incredibly slower than it should be.


The main idea is to destroy the monopoly on information. This monopoly hinders progress. Leave from Google and Facebook only companies that create algorithms, and do not sell personal (depersonalized) data on the monopoly. I’m not sure about all what I write, so please correct me and tell me the truth.


# Definitions:
1. user is a person (or any other object including an inanimate one) about which we just record the data, adding new records about it.
2. Editor - any system or the user or other users who writes information about the user.
3. User data - all data in one way or another related or created by a particular user. User data consists of a set of records. It also means, for example, a full credit history from all banks, electronic diaries, or data from paper school diaries or school magazines, and from any other registers certified by an electronic signature of the organization. All search queries, messages and friends list for example certified by an electronic Facebook signature.
4. Record - any information or executable code [Video, personal data, texts, gps, visited sites ...]. Each entry has a digital signature of the person or organization that made this record, the recording time and information about the original source of the recording. Records are copied to multiple computers, giving constant access and protecting against changes or losses.
5. Supplement - a record in the data of the user, which is tied to another record of the same user. For example, comment, like, offer record corrections.


For example, you are a user, open the Google search engine, and after entering your request Google finds your profile - User data and adds a record about your request, after which it can add to this record supplement how long you were on this or that page issued on this request, or the location from which you make the request.


# Rules:


1. User data must belong to the user and is stored either on his personal computer or wherever he wishes. He should have the right to disclose, sell, alienate them to anyone. These data may belong to companies (for example, user searches may belong to Google, correspondence to facebook, personal files and criminal records to the Ministry of Justice), but only if all these data are in full and accessible for processing volume, belong to the user.
2. The editor can be any. User data can be added to anyone by adding supplement to an existing record or adding a new one.
3. Any record is signed by the digital signature of the editor and the time stamp.
4. Give the rights to view or change the record can give either the user since the data about him belong to him, and the editor, since all the records he enters are also belong to editor, if there were no preliminary alienation agreements.
5. A record no one can ever delete. You can simply close access rights to it from all if you the user or the editor.
6. Records that do not enjoy viewing popularity can be compressed and sent to the archive without worrying that they were available online.
In this case, companies such as Acxiom concentrating personal data from different locations for targeting advertising or data transmission FBR will be able to buy them not only from Facebook and Google, but also from users themselves interested in providing them with the most complete and reliable information (for example, reliable profile). Also an example of data filling rules that will allow the system to grow independently.




# Approximate mechanism:


The user opens a file system located on his computer, for recording and viewing. Organization of the Google type or any other editors including the user or other users has the right to write and view only the folders for which they are given access or can create their own folder. Any record is signed by the digital signature of the organization making this record and has a timestamp. This entry is copied to n other computers in an encrypted form and can not be deleted by one user.


With the help of the digital signature of the recording person, we are forced to answer for what was written down getting rid of spam and insults. The record can be regulated by the usual legislation. The record can be protected from changes to the user (for example, data on criminal records) and is always available due to the fact that it was copied to other computers. All records can be encrypted and accessible only to those who made these records and to the user himself, as well as those to whom the owners (user or editor) gave access.


Any copying is accompanied by the signature of the source or is considered illegal. For the motivation to provide as much useful information as possible for each download or viewing the source is entitled to a bonus. If the network has information without a signature on the source, it is easy to calculate who illegally distributed it by looking at the signatures of the downloaded - this is the circle of suspects. If the record is viewed and recorded a new similar entry, then having two identical records, you can determine the source by the timestamp.


Such a system is common in a block system, you can save resources on proofofwork giving priority to those nodes that have more downloaded information (hence the information is reliable). To avoid the fact that half of the nodes will be fake, adding a new user is at the invitation of another user. I also think that many of the data can be made anonymous, but keep the link to the user. For example depersonalized, to show records only about the pages visited but not about the personal profile data.




# Benefits


Now the information market is monopolized and contradicts the basics of healthy competition, hindering the development of society.
We will decentralize the information and this is very natural. Imagine that when communicating with a friend you can not just come up and say something to him, instead you would need to first report all the facebook and he would have already passed it on to your friend. And to remember how you spent a honeymoon, you would have to go to Google, because your memory does not belong to you. And at any time you can disable access from these resources (like in China or just banned from the ethical considerations of shareholders). And you will never remember the honeymoon or tell something important to your friend. Memory and language are already decentralized by evolution, so let's oppose their unnatural centralization. Centralization was caused by technological limitations (few computers, weak and not common technologies), and simply a powerful infusion of PR funds, which fully paid off in the form of a monopoly on other people's data. Now every modern person can receive, change and give information 24 hours a day.


If users are owners of their own information, this motivates them to disclose more and more important and useful information. In this way, we will add and merge data from all applications - this will allow us to predict any human actions by reducing errors. It will also allow you to verify the authenticity of the data and not lose it, even if you disable applications.
Such a table in the future when connecting the Internet of things will contain the whole story, from the moment you woke up, that you ate, pulse, weight, what you were doing, until the moment you got sick and why you died. This will allow them to quickly train, heal and just protect people from failures by learning that 100 others had a similar situation and 30 of them were cured / learned / became happy - having done so and so.
This will enable growth of start-ups, which fall apart either because they do not have enough data, or because they repeat the mistakes of others. And each of these start-ups could give excellent predictive algorithms.
Given that a record can be both a code and a program at the same time, you can put and run clients for any applications, giving them permission to use other records. This will divide startups into good usability developers and startups that collect data well.


# Implementation:

Now there are a lot of decentralized databases on the technology of blockchain built in the form of cryptocurrency. There are torrent clients, there are decentralized instant messengers matrix, tox, jabber and distributed databases like cassandra or we can just use Linux ... I wanted you to advise whether it is possible to make this application based on existing ones. It is necessary to encrypt data, distribute them to nodes, avoid collisions, distribute roles for recording, viewing, changing. You can add a crypto currency according to the rule for viewing information -1, who is viewing and whose information is +1 and who is storing it. Also take part of the income on promoting this product for competition with Facebook and Google. But it would be desirable, that the system was light enough as all data at all to be stored does not turn out and it is impossible to limit speed of record.
